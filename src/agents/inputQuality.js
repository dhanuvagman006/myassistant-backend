/**
 * INPUT QUALITY — is this sentence safe to act on?
 * ------------------------------------------------
 * Speech-to-text hands the assistant nonsense more often than anyone
 * expects: a cough becomes "con", a spoken phone number arrives as bare
 * digits, Tulu comes back as Japanese. The model, asked to be helpful,
 * fills the gap from the last thing it understood — which is how "con"
 * placed a call to the previous contact, and how a phone number was read
 * as "call Loki sir".
 *
 * This module judges the TEXT ONLY, before any tool can run:
 *   clear   — act on it normally
 *   weak    — understandable but thin; fine for talk, not for actions
 *             that touch the world (calls, messages, app launches)
 *   garbled — do not act at all; ask the user to repeat
 *
 * The rule it enforces downstream (src/tools/registry.js) is simple and
 * structural: an action tool may not run on garbled input, and may not
 * INHERIT its subject from an earlier turn when the input is weak.
