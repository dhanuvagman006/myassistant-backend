# Base: node:20-slim (Debian/glibc), NOT alpine. Reason: better-sqlite3 is
# a native module with PREBUILT binaries for glibc — on slim it installs
# instantly with zero compilation. On alpine (musl) there is no prebuilt
# binary, so node-gyp must compile from source AND download Node headers
# from unofficial-builds.nodejs.org — which fails on flaky networks
# (ETIMEDOUT) and adds minutes to every build. Slim is ~40 MB larger and
# completely reliable; that is the right trade for a production API.

# ---------- Stage 1: install deps ----------
FROM node:20-slim AS builder

# Toolchain as a FALLBACK: normally better-sqlite3's prebuilt binary just
# downloads (fast path). But that download comes from GitHub Releases,
# which some networks block/timeout — in that case node-gyp compiles the
# module locally instead. npm_config_nodedir points gyp at the headers
# already inside this image, so the compile needs NO downloads at all.

# ca-certificates is REQUIRED, not cosmetic. @livekit/rtc-node's WebRTC
# layer is native Rust and validates TLS against the SYSTEM trust store,
# which node:20-slim ships empty. Node's own fetch bundles its CAs, so
# HTTPS calls to BeyondPresence succeed while the LiveKit connection dies
# with "no native root CA certificates found" — the avatar fails and
# nothing else does. Keep this even if the image is slimmed further.
